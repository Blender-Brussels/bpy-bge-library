ProcessingBGE's purpose is to simplify the use of the blender game engine python API.

HOW TO:
*******

* Basic:
********
To start a new "problender" project, just copy/paste the folder "problender" and rename the folder and "processing.blend" (not required)

* Advanced:
***********
If you don't want to use the problender template, the setup is a bit more complex.

** 1.
ProcessigBGE requires one scenes and two layers: an active layer and a "storage" layer
When you call "configure" method, template object will be loaded from the storage layer via "Edit object" actuators
You can add custom templates via the same process, the method to ducplicate them is(will) createFrom( [object name] ) 

** 2.
Last point: you'll have to call ProcessingBGE.configure() once, and ProcessingBGE.update() at each frame.
