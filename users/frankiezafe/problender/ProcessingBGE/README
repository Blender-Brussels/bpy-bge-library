ProcessingBGE's purpose is to simplify the use of the blender game engine python API.

HOW TO:
*******

* Basic:
********
To start a new "problender" project, just copy/paste the folder "problender" and rename the folder and "processing.blend" (not required)

* Advanced:

If you don't want to use the problender template, the setup is a bit more complex.

** 1.
ProcessigBGE requires two scenes: an render scene, used for display, and a resource scene, used to store template objects.
When you call "configure" method, the object will search for the 2 scenes.
If they are not there, the ProcessingBGE will never consider itself as "configured".
You can specify the names of the scenes to use, by default "render" & "resources".

** 2.
You also have to link the keyboard and the mouse to a specific script of the library
Mouse sensors must be linked to ProcessingBGE/ProcessingMouse.py.
Keyboard sensors must be linked to ProcessingBGE/ProcessingKeyboard.py.

** 3.
Last point: you'll have to call ProcessingBGE.configure() once, and ProcessingBGE.update() at each frame.
