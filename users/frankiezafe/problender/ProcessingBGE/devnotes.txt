**
to be able to duplicate objects, objects should be linked to an edit object actuator
to clenup everything, a root object should be placed at 0,0,0 and use as ref when duplicating
+ template objects should be placed in an hidden layer (the second one, for instance)
+ all sensors/controllers/actuators linked to root, and not camera
...
a lot of refactoring is to be done!

'''
import bge
scene = bge.logic.getCurrentScene()
#bge.logic.getCurrentController().owner
ob = scene.objects['root']
ob1 = scene.addObject("Cylinder", ob)
ob2 = scene.addObject("Cylinder", ob)
vec = ob1.worldPosition
vec.x += 1
print(ob1, ob2)

there is a way to register a method to be called at each frame!
'''
scene = logic.getCurrentScene()
scene.post_draw = [write]
'''
to be done once!
this means: the setup is done by grabbing an error:
'''
scene = logic.getCurrentScene()
scene.post_draw = [write]
'''
