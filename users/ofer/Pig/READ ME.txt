Instructions:

Installation: Place the plugin in your "/Library/Graphics/Quartz Composer Plug-Ins/" folder.

Quartz Composer
- Create an instance of the plug-in from the Patch Creator of Quartz Composer

VDMX
- Install the enclosed VDMX qcFX to ~/Library/Application Support/VDMX/qcFX
- In VDMX, drag the plugin from the Effects Panel on to a layer
- Select a layer to use as the delay map
- If you are using a still image for the delay map you will get better performance creating your own composition qcFX with the image embedded in the composition.

____

Settings:

Buffer Size (Frames)
- The number of frames to buffer to produce the final image.

Ports:

Image
- An image from a video source or other stream of images which will be buffered.

Delay
- The maximum amount of delay to apply where the delay map calls for the most delay (0 will always show the current frame, 1 will apply delay up to the size of the buffer).

Delay Map
- An image used to determine delay applied across the final image. The most delay will occur where this image is lightest.

____

Usage notes:

The biggest differences to performance will be made by using smaller (in pixel area) frames in the Image input, and keeping the Buffer Size setting low.
